# Detecting flash crash events using Deep Reinforcement Learning


## <a id="overview"></a>Overview
Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is one of the most recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies that has been applied cross-industry in very different use cases. In this Blueprint we will be exploring a DRL AI module that tries to detect the event of a flash crash. Building on the GAN Blueprint Flash Crash synthetic Data with Generative Adversarial Networks we will be using the features generated there, enhance the modelling space a bit more and try to train a DRL agent to understand the environment and give as an early detection signal of some possible abnormality within the market microstructure. We will be using Tensorforce as our Deep Reinforcement Learning framework a very recent module built from the Tensorforce team.

Details and concepts are further explained in the [Detecting flash crash events using Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/article-catalog/article/modelling-and-evaluation-deep-reinforcement-learning-flash-crashes.html) Blueprint published on the [Refinitiv Developer Community portal](https://developers.refinitiv.com).
